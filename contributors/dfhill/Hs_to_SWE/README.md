# snowdensity

We have prepared scripts in Matlab, Jupyter Notebook, and Python that will calculate snow water 
equivalent based on day, month, year, lat, lon, and snow depth at the observation point. 

These scripts are associated with: 
Hill, D.F., Burakowski, E.A., Crumley, R.L., Keon, J., Hu, J.M., Arendt, A.A., Wikstrom Jones, K., Wolken G.J., 2019, "Converting snow depth to snow water equivalent using climatological variables," The Cryosphere, v.13, pp.1767-1784 https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-13-1767-2019

In this repo you will find a single matlab (.m) function file, a single jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file, 
a single python (.py) file, two zipped ESRI ASCII grid files, and one (.rtf) file with information 
about the grid files. The grids contain climatological normals of winter precipitation (Dec-Jan-Feb) 
and temperature difference (diff between mean T of warmest month and mean T of coldest month). 
To use, unzip the grids and place them in the same location as the .m, .ipynb, or .py file. 

The SWE calculator implements a power law regression in order to produce a value of snow water 
equivalent (SWE) based on various parameters associated with a snow depth measurement. The  
following information on units, etc., is critical:

## User defined inputs: 
H - snow depth (mm)  
Y - year  
M - month (1 --> 12)  
D - day (1 --> 31 (or 28, or 30, as appropriate))  
LAT - latitude. Positive for N. Hem.  
LON - longitude (signed). So, -120 or so for North America.  

## SWE calculator outputs:
SWE - snow water equivalent (mm) 
DOY - day of water year (Oct 1 is the origin, i.e. DOY=1)  

Specific script information is below. 

### Matlab function

function [SWE,DOY] = dfhill_swe_calculator(Y,M,D,H,LAT,LON)  
The input variables can be scalars (single measurement) or vectors (batch measurements).

### Jupyter Notebook & Python scripts

The input variables can be a list or an array of one or more values.

Required modules/packages:  
import numpy as np  
from osgeo import gdal  
from scipy.interpolate import interp2d  
from datetime import date
